# Stock Tracker — (My First Python Project)

Welcome to my very first Python project! This stock tracker project allowed me to learn how to fetch, analyze, and visualize financial data using code. It’s a simple but meaningful step in my journey toward combining finance with technology. This project exposed me to python packages such as yfinance, matplotlib and pandas.

Project Goals
- Learn the basics of Python programming
- Understand how to work with financial data programmatically
- Build a tool that visualizes stock trends and indicators
- Lay the foundation for future data-driven finance projects

Features
- Search for any stock by ticker symbol
- Fetch real-time and historical price data
- Plot stock charts with moving averages
